Transfer learning project for bird classification (uses ResNet 50)

Loads a ResNet50 model and trains a set of bird/ non birds clasification images
Repository can be extended to real world scenarios by adding files to the training_data directory

This repostiory has few sample training data files. If you would like to download the entire training data set download the zip file from the following link:
